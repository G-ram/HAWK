innerhtml=Standing at 5'9, Srikar was ranked the #1 shooting guard in India. Known for a deadly jumpshot but absolutely no speed, stamina, or muscle, he was widely regarded as a shooting threat that would add greatly to Columbia's limited offensive skillset. However, after coming to Columbia to play on the basketball team, Srikar sadly found out that American basketball is drastically different from Indian basketball.
